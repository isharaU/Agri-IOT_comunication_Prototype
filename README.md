# IoT Soil Monitoring and Drone Communication System

## Project Overview

This project combines IoT technology and drone communication to create a soil monitoring and analysis system. It utilizes two ESP8266 boards, one for soil data collection and the other for communication with a drone using IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) protocol.

## Key Components

- **Soil Sensor Node:** An ESP8266 board with buried soil sensors (moisture, temperature, pH).
- **Communication Hub:** Another ESP8266 board for data processing and drone communication.
- **Data Processing:** Analyzes soil data for informed decision-making.
- **Drone Communication:** Sends commands to the drone based on soil conditions.

## Project Goals

- Real-time soil condition monitoring.
- Efficient data transmission and analysis.
- Intelligent drone control for agriculture or environmental tasks.

## Benefits

- Improved agriculture practices and resource management.
- Reduced manual labor for soil monitoring.
- Enhanced crop yield and environmental insights.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Set up the ESP8266 boards with relevant libraries.
3. Customize drone commands and data analysis as needed.
4. Run the code on the ESP8266 boards.
5. Monitor soil conditions and drone actions.
