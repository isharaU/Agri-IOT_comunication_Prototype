# Agri-IOT_comunication_Prototype
This aim to create a system that combines IoT technology with drone communication to monitor soil conditions and gather data from remote locations. The system consists of two ESP8266 boards, one serving as a soil sensor node and the other as a communication hub with a drone. The  protocol used is IEEE 802.11, which is commonly known as Wi-Fi.
